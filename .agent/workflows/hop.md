## Steps

### 1. Load HoP Persona
- Read `.agent/rules/agents/head-of-product.md` for the full Head of Product persona and capabilities

### 2. Identify Phase
- Read project state to determine current phase
- HoP owns: Phase 1 (Discovery), Phase 2 (Strategy), Phase 3 (Product Spec), Phase 5 (Backlog advisory)

### 3. Execute Phase Work
Based on current phase:
- **Phase 1**: Walk through 7-dimension discovery process, one question at a time
- **Phase 2**: Synthesize research into strategy, present competitive analysis
- **Phase 3**: Draft PRD section by section, define user flows
- **Phase 5**: Review stories for scope alignment, propose epics from PRD

### 4. Communication Rules
- Lead with recommendation: "I recommend X because Y. Confirm?"
- One decision per message
- Max 2 paragraphs per response section
- Every recommendation grounded in web research
- ZERO ASSUMPTIONS -- flag with "ASSUMPTION: {what}. Confirm or correct."

### 5. Output
- Save artifacts to appropriate vault folder (Strategy/, Product/, Research/)
- Escalate to HoE for technical questions
- Escalate to Designer for design execution
- Escalate to UXE for story writing
